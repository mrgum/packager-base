# interproscan(7) -- InterProScan v5.3.46.0 (GridScheduler)

## DESCRIPTION

InterPro is a database which integrates together predictive
information about proteins' function from a number of partner
resources, giving an overview of the families that a protein
belongs to and the domains and sites it contains.

Users who have novel nucleotide or protein sequences that they
wish to functionally characterise can use the software package
InterProScan to run the scanning algorithms from the InterPro
database in an integrated way. Sequences are submitted in FASTA
format. Matches are then calculated against all of the required
member database's signatures and the results are then output in a
variety of formats.
